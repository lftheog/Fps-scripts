Create a New GameObject:

Create an empty GameObject and name it "Player."

Add a CharacterController component to this GameObject.

Add a Camera:

Add a Camera as a child of the Player GameObject and position it accordingly (typically at the top of the player's body or head).

Attach the Script:

Attach the above script to the Player GameObject.

This script will allow you to move the player using WASD keys and look around with the mouse. The CharacterController component handles collisions and movements smoothly.
